# A place for odds and ends
Not much to say as far as READMEs go, I don't think. Just a repo to keep track of all of the little things that I write to make my life a little bit easier. Are they all great? No. Do they all work? Also... maybe no. But are they all free to use if you'd like? Go right ahead!
